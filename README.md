## Guidelines for instructors:

1. Make sure that the student fully understand the first 6 topics on the lists above. You teach last topic once you think that the student has mastered the first 6 topics. 

2. Don't rush with the students. Teach them the materials, test them in class, and give them homework. Always review the materials taught in the previous class and check their homework. Don't continue teaching new materials unless the student fully can solve the homework problems.
